<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

## Project Overview

As a UCF undergraduate researcher, I am utilizing the OpenAI, also known as ChatGPT-4 API, in conjunction with Python scripts to assess and compare its capabilities in common sense reasoning with ChatGPT-3.5. My undergraduate research project focuses on assessing the capabilities of LLM (Large Language Model) and VLM (Very Large Language Model) in cube stacking for common-sense planning challenges. The primary objective of this project is to generate optimized sequences of events to address cube-stacking challenges using OpenAI, particularly in the context of the Cube Stacking problem, which is one of the most renowned planning domains in the realm of artificial intelligence. In this challenge, the goal is to construct one or more vertical stacks of blocks to transform the initial state into the goal state. Notably, only one block may be moved at a time, and it can be placed either on the table or on top of another block, with the condition that a block cannot be moved if another block is resting on it.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Getting Started

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/christina8711/llm_cubestacking.git
   ```
   - This step clones the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd llm_cubestacking
   ```
   - Change your working directory to the newly cloned repository.

3. **Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed):**
   - Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. You can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

4. **Install project-specific dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   - Use this command to install the project-specific Node.js packages and dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Create a controlled environment, simulating a real-world 'table' scenario, for ChatGPT-4 to operate within.
- [ ] Scale up the cube stacking problem to further challenge ChatGPT-4's common sense reasoning capabilities.
    - [ ] This includes increasing the number of blocks in the problem and introducing random changes to the controlled environment.
- [ ] Provide feedback to ChatGPT-4 in case of an error.
    - [ ]  If ChatGPT's response is incorrect, communicate that a mistake was made.
    - [ ] Try again if needed.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/christina8711/llm_cubestacking/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
